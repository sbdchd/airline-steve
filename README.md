# airline-steve

A theme for [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline).

This is based off of the
[hybrid](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes/blob/master/autoload/airline/themes/hybrid.vim),
[jellybeans](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes/blob/master/autoload/airline/themes/jellybeans.vim),
and
[lucius](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes/blob/master/autoload/airline/themes/lucius.vim)
themes.

It should ideally be paired with the [hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid) color scheme.
